Sample input file can be replaced with another file to find the prices.
Input file format is [CARD_NAME] | [CARD_SET] | [QUANTITY]
Auto correct does not work very well. So it can be turned on and off by changing the digit at the top of the input.txt file. (1 for on, 0 for off)
The result gets saved into output.txt, and gets displayed on the console.
